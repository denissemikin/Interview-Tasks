* Task 1 FP solution - using scala built into `map` and `count` methods. 
We convert string into lowercase, split string into characters, getting only unique characters and count how many 
times some unique character exists in our list of characters;

* Task 1 FP recursion solution - using recursion for iterate through list of characters
and patter matching for getting head and tail of list

* Task 1 FP imperative solution - using simple `for` loop for iterate
